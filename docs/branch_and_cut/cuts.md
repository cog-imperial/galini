# Cut Generation & Cut Pool

## Cut Generation

At every iteration of the cut loop, GALINI generates new cuts by delegating cut
generation to *cut generators*. Cut generators implement the
 [CutsGenerator](api.md) interface.
 
## Cut Pool

All cuts are stored in a *cut pool*. Before starting the cut loop at each branch
and bound node, GALINI will go through valid cuts for that node and add any
violated cuts.

Cuts are considered valid for a node if they were generated by one of the node's
parents.
